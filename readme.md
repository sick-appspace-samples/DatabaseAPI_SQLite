## DatabaseAPI_SQLite

Introduction to the DataBase-API.

### Description

The application itself creates a simple database and allows the user to insert
data into and perform queries on it. The user interface provides text fields to
fill the fields of the database to insert new data and a possibility to send a query.
It is possible to send a user-defined or a predefined query.
The results of the insertions and queries are printed on the page.

### How to run

Connect a web-browser to the AppEngine (localhost address "127.0.0.1") and you will
see the web-page of this sample.
Fill in the data fields in the "Input Data" section and press "INSERT" to insert data
into the database.
Write a query in the text field in the "Query" section and press "EXECUTE" to perform a
user defined query.
To perform a predefined query, simply press the buttons in the "Query Templates" section.
See the "Result" section for any output of the database.
The UI itself is created using the UI builder. It can be found by clicking the
"database.msdd". In the drop-down menu at the upper right "Database" can be selected.
More information can be found in the tutorials.
